            The Blog section of the EOLO website serves as a powerful tool for the prominent Italian internet provider. It was
            specifically created with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) in mind, promoting EOLO's products through well-crafted
            articles. The main objective was to enhance the company's online presence and reach a broader audience while
            simultaneously boosting the website's ranking on search engines.
          </p>
          <p>
            This entire section was developed using Magnolia CMS, a powerful content management system based on
            the Content Repository API for Java. This advanced platform facilitates developers in generating templates that grant
            the clients the ability to create articles autonomously. This feature significantly reduces the dependency on developers
            for content creation, thereby speeding up the overall process.
          </p>
          <div className="project-image">
            <Image src={blog_seo} alt="Blog SEO"/>
          </div>
          <p>
            Moreover, the system offers the possibility of adding structured data. This enhancement is a powerful way to improve
            SEO as it provides search engines with explicit clues about the content on a web page. The use of structured data is a
            proven method to improve web page ranking and visibility in search engines, ultimately driving more organic traffic to
            the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            The articles created through this system are well-indexed due to the particular attention paid to SEO. The SEO strategies
            employed ensure that the content is easily discoverable by search engines, thus improving its visibility to potential
            customers searching for relevant keywords.

            Much of the content in this section is editorial, which allows the client to be autonomous in content management.
            They have the freedom to create, edit, or delete articles without the need to contact developers. This not only saves
            time but also allows for real-time content adjustments as per the evolving needs of the business or market trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, clients have the flexibility to manage which articles to highlight. This feature is particularly beneficial
            for promoting specific content, such as new product releases or special offers. The system also allows for the promotion
            of highlighted articles even on the homepage, increasing their visibility and reach.
